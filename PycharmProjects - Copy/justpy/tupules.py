# tuples can be used to store a list of items ,but we can't modify them can't add or remove new items
# we can't mutate or change them
# we use square brackets[] to define lists
# we use brackets () to define tupules
# we can only use index or count
numbers =(1,2,3)
numbers[0]
print (numbers[0])

# unpacking works for list and tupules

x,y,z = coordinates
