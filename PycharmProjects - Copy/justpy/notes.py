 # pyton runs code line by line from top
 #  anytime there are words in between quotations you re defining a string
 # strings are series of characters
 # expressions are piece of code that produces a value
 # variables to store data
 # integers are numbers without decimal
 # input receive message and it would always be a string
 # when ever you are expecting a numerical value you should always convert that string into an integer or flot
 # concatination to combine to a string (+)
 # what ever you type in the input is string
 # int() convert string to an integer
 # float() convert string to a flot or decimal
 # bool() convert string to a boolean value
 # type() to know the type of variable
 # to get an index in python you use square brackets ([])
 # in python we can do negative index this returns a character from the end ([-1]
 # when a function is specific to an object it is called method example (upper)
 # A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects
 # N objects is an instance of a class. When you create an object from a class
 # key points about objects
 # Attribute These are variables that hold data related to the objects example
 # brand and color
 # Methods These are functions that define the behaviour of the objects
 # example start
 # each objects can have the same attributes but all objects from same class share the same methods
 # when python does not find what we are looking for in a string it returns-1(meaning what we are looking for does not exist)

# Arithemetic
# we have two types of division
#(/ ) returns flot
# (//) returns whole number
# (%) returns a reminder of the division
# (**) returns the power (power)
 #tip
 # as a developer you know what you expect your code to do or the value you expect it to return

# Logic operator
# And both condition is true
# Or one condition is true
# Not automatically converts to either true or false

# DRY = Don't Reapt Yourself
# using triple quote allows you to write multiple line characters with having to use \n
